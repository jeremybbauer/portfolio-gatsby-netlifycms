## Hi! I'm Jeremy.

### I'm a content designer/UX writer and comic book lover from Indiana.

I write product copy and technical documentation that makes websites/apps easier to use. My most recent role was at InVision, and before that I managed an instructional design department at the University of Illinois.

I've also had poetry, fiction, and nonfiction published in various literary magazines. To keep writing for fun as well as for work, I created a fiction blog called [Moon Computer](https://www.mooncomputer.space/) with three rules to make the habit stick:

1. Keep it **spooky** 💀.
2. Keep it **fun** ⚡.
3. No matter what, publish **weekly** 🗓️.
